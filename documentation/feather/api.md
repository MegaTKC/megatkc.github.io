# API
The PocketMine API is really old, that no one really uses it anymore. It has to be re-documented so people will understand how to create plugins
and how to make your server a better environment.

If you haven't done the plugin base, please get started on that. <a href="http://megatkc.github.io/documentation/feather/creating-plugins.html">Click here to start your plugin!</a>
